# Case File: Inbox Sanitizer (Communication Substrate) 🧼

> **"I was just starting out as a junior developer when my friend came to me, looking completely defeated. Her email was a disaster—800 spam messages if she missed a single day. Facebook notifications, sales ads, random people she didn't know... it was making her job search a nightmare. She'd miss important interview requests just because they were buried in the noise.**
>
> **She was considering creating her third new email address in a year. 'I can't keep doing this,' she told me. 'There has to be a way to automate the madness.'**
>
> **That was the day I wrote my first real script. It wasn't fancy, and it wasn't elegant, but it changed everything.**
>
> **I decided to build her a custom solution that wouldn't just 'filter'—it would sanitize. I wrote a script that didn't treat every email as equal. It looked for the jobs, the humans, and the actual signals, then aggressively neutralized everything else.**
>
> **My solution? I built a rule-based engine that acted like a digital secretary. It learned which domains were recruiters and which were just retail noise. It matched job descriptions against her resume and flagged them for immediate attention.**
>
> **The day I ran it for her, we watched 2,000 unread messages vanish. What was left? Three interview invites and a message from a friend she'd lost track of. She didn't need a new email. She just needed a way to fight back."**

## 🏛️ FORENSIC SUMMARY: The Communication Integrity Pillar
Inbox Sanitizer is a high-fidelity **Communication Substrate** designed for the automated neutralization of low-salience influx. It moves beyond standard spam filters by applying personage-aware heuristics to ensure the "Signal" is never lost in the "Noise."

### 🧠 The Sanitization Engine
1. **Domain Sovereignty**: White-listing verified professional domains (.edu, institutional partners) while blackloading retail trackers.
2. **Contextual Signal Detection**: Matching incoming message semantics against active "Salience Profiles" (e.g., Job Search, Project Coordination).
3. **Automated Neutralization**: A recurring scheduler that purges verified low-value communications to maintain a "Zero Entropy" state.
